            For centuries, architectural models have been playing an important role in the teaching and practice of architecture as well as being simulated in exhibitions and exams. 
            3D modeling allows architects and judges to explore the building through perspective, thereby understanding the structure of the construction system, 
            and the relationship with the surrounding space.

    In the process of implementing architectural or table models, the most important factor to create beautiful models is the material that makes the model. 
    The materials used in the process of making architectural models or tools used in the process of making architectural models are quite diverse and paper is 1 of the options that are considered easy to shape to create vivid and realistic shimmering 3D models.

    To be able to produce a famous 3D model of the building used for floating paper cards to be lifelike, 
    In addition to the image design, the assembly stage requires the sophistication and care of the workers in the finishing process.

<span style="font-size: 15px;">
    With the current development trend, 
    When machines are gradually changing architectural models, materials make architectural models in other words, the paper architectural model has since changed significantly. 
    Thanks to laser cutting machines, we can create small and sharp details to assemble for 3D models.

    Nowadays, the production of architectural models for real estate projects is a necessity for project owners, 
    they work with 3D models to introduce the project to partners and customers to help them better understand the location and image of the project.

    3D cards with building models are formed on the basis of a design that simulates the structure, shape, and size 
    the details of the building are then cut with a laser cutter, followed by docking to form a finished model that fits in the card.
