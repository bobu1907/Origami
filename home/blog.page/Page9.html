        Dead organ donors were able to donate their hearts. 
        The patient's family is extremely grateful for this great sacrifice and it is touching that the boy who received the heart donation that year is now successful but still do not forget the merits of the benefactor, so commissioned a paper art heart in remembrance.

<h1>Body parts</h1>
<hr>
A deceased donor can donate both kidneys, liver, lungs, heart, and pancreas. 
Living donors can donate: a kidney, lung, or part of the liver, pancreas, or intestines. 
The kidneys are the most commonly transplanted organ. The world's first kidney transplant was successfully performed in 1954, 
In Boston, surgeon Joseph Murray saved the life of a patient named Ronal Richard who suffered from severe kidney failure. 
The patient donated a kidney by his own brother. 
In addition, the intestine is one of the rarest types of organ transplantation, 
almost exclusively applies to patients who have to have at least half of their intestines removed due to a disease such as Crohn's. 
Intestines are transplanted from deceased patients, but can also be donated by living people. Germany was the first country to have a successful bowel transplant in 1988.

<h1>Eyes</h1>

One corneal donor - 4 people get rid of blindness. 
Two donor eyes are donated to help people with eye damage due to illness, injury, or birth defects. 
The cornea is the outermost layer of the eye that helps focus vision. 
In addition to the cornea, the donor can also donate the sclera, which is the outer layer of the eyeball.

<hr>
<h1>Tissue</h1>
<hr>
One person donating organs can save 8 lives, but when donating tissue, the number of people saved is 50 people. 
Possible donation: heart valves, skin, bones, veins, cartilage, ligaments.

<hr>
<h1>Blood stem cells, ligaments, bone marrow</h1>
<hr>
Healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 60 can donate bone marrow, cord blood stem cells, and cells to peripheral blood radicals. 
Unlike corneal donation, i.e. the donor and corneal donor do not need to "match" each other, 
the stem cell donor must have a match to the donor's tissue type or white blood cell antigen (HLA).

<hr>
<h1>Blood and platelets</h1>
<hr>
Donating blood and platelets is one of the easiest ways donors can save lives.
