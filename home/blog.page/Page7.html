<span style="font-size: 15px;">
    We already know what Halloween is, but do you know the origins of this day? 
    In fact, Halloween dates back 2,000 years. This festival is of Celtic origin, inhabiting the lands of Ireland, 
    England and Northern France now. According to the religious beliefs of the Celts, they assumed that on the eve of the New Year, 
    the boundary between the yin and yang worlds is very blurred, making it possible for the dead to return to the earthly realm. 
    Therefore, they lit fires and dressed up in many strange shapes, in order to drive away evil spirits and welcome back lost relatives.

    If you ask western kids what day Halloween is, they'll tell them it's a day to play "Trick or Treat." 
    (for candy or teased). This custom began to gain popularity in the United States in the 1960s. On Halloween, 
    Children in the neighborhood often dress up and invite each other to knock on doors to ask for candy. 
    It is conceived that these babies are "playing" returning souls, therefore, giving candy also represents a sharing for the souls of the deceased. 
    If they are not given candy, they can play dicks and poke fun at the landlord. However, to this day, this custom has gradually become more polite, homeowners who want to give candy will often foreshadow, 
    and families who do not want to participate in this game will not be disturbed anymore.
