    The five colors present in the works are the colors of the five elements: blue, red, yellow, brown and green. 
    The background background is made minimalist with two black and white colors representing day and night, yin and yang, 
    as well as the great difference between Luo Longjun and Au Co that led to the two having to divide the children up and down the sea.

    Talking about choosing a paper work for the project, photographer Harry Vu (center) shared: 
    "When developing the idea and forming the materials for this project, I wanted it to be an artistic design context, 
    soaring, rather than building models of porous, wood, PVC. I was lucky to know Tuan Pham - a talented paper artist. 
    Together with me and the creative team, Tuan has made an impressive finish for the project."

<h1>Project</h1>
<hr>
<span style="font-size: 15px;">
    The project "Hong Bang family" consists of 22 photos, revolving around the legend of Hong Bang family through the story of Lac Long Quan and Au Co.

    The photographer decided to carry out the project with 35mm footage with his favorite Leica camera. 
    The entire image will be kept the same, not edited to be able to keep the soul and rusticity of Vietnamese people and culture.
    The exhibition is open for free from January 8 to January 14, 2021 at Hai An Gallery (Q1). On the first day, the exhibition attracted 1,500 visitors. 
    Most of the visitors here are young visitors or families, bringing their children to see and hear about the legend of Lac Long Quan - Au Co.
