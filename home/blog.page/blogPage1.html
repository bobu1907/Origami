<b>Origami</b> (Japanese: 折り紙, Japanese pronunciation: [oɾiɡami] or [oɾiꜜɡami]) is a type of paper folding art originating in Japan. The Japanese word origami is derived from two words: ori is folded or folded and kami is paper. Origami has only been used since 1880, before that, the Japanese used the word orikata. Origami combines simple folding ways to turn a rectangular piece of paper (2 dimensions),
which are usually squares, into complex shapes (3 dimensions), no collage during folding,
this is also the trend of modern origami. Unlike commonly thought, traditional Japanese origami rules (starting around the Edo Dynasty of 1603-1867)[1], less stringent than modern origami: folded paper can be round, triangular, and collage can be collaged during folding.

<h1>History</h1>

<span style="font-size: 20px;">
    Paper folding has been around since the 1st or 2nd century in China. Later, this paper folding art spread to Japan in the 6th century and gradually became a unique art of Cherry Blossom.
    Traditional Japanese origami may be used for rituals, such as noshi (Muromachi dynasty 1392–1573).

    Origami can be as simple as the boat or paper plane we're used to, but it can also be as complex as a dragon,
    phoenix, Eiffel Tower. Complex origami models can use thin metal foil instead of plain paper to reduce the thickness of the folded pattern.
    Modern origami vary greatly, patterns are often folded when wet (wet folding) or using materials other than paper and metal foil. 
    The Japanese view origami as part of the country's culture and traditions rather than as an art form.
    
    One of the best known origami specimens is the crane shape. The crane is an auspicious omen in Japanese conception. 
    Legend has it that whoever folds 1000 paper cranes can make a wish come true. After the story of Japanese girl Sasaki Sadako in 1955, 
    The image of the paper crane also became a symbol of peace.

    Almost every most complex folding pattern can be attributed to simple steps according to tree theory. For example, if you want to fold a cat, the head, body and tail 
    is a straight line like a tree trunk, 4 legs forming four branches like branches. 
    Apply the principles in topological geometry to create projections, find out the paper corners are legs, heads ... etc... 
    Today there are many origami manuals. Computers also contribute significantly to the creation of new models.
    
    Today there are still a large number of origami lovers, however to pursue and learn to fold, 
    the way to compose new models is not possible for everyone, because it requires patience and care in each folding step. 
    Moreover, the number of folds is directly proportional to the complexity of the sample, a simple folding pattern like a butterfly also goes through 100 steps. 
    In Vietnam, there are also groups of origami lovers who work online, offline, exchanging information and sending new compositions.
