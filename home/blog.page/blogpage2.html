            Cranes are a family, the Gruidae, of large, long-legged, and long-necked birds in the group Gruiformes. The 15 species of cranes are placed in three genera, Antigone, Balearica, and Grus. Unlike the similar-looking but unrelated herons, cranes fly with necks outstretched, not pulled back. Cranes live on most continents, with the exception of Antarctica and South America.

            They are opportunistic feeders that change their diets according to the season and their own nutrient requirements. They eat a range of items from small rodents, eggs of birds, fish, amphibians, and insects to grain and berries.
            
            Cranes construct platform nests in shallow water, and typically lay two eggs at a time. Both parents help to rear the young, which remain with them until the next breeding season.
            
            Some species and populations of cranes migrate over long distances; others do not migrate at all. Cranes are solitary during the breeding season, occurring in pairs, but during the nonbreeding season, most species are gregarious, forming large flocks where their numbers are sufficient.
            
            Most species of cranes have been affected by human activities and are at the least classified as threatened, if not critically endangered. The plight of the whooping cranes of North America inspired some of the first US legislation to protect endangered species.

    One of the best known origami specimens is the crane shape. 
    The crane is an auspicious omen in Japanese conception. 
    Legend has it that whoever folds 1000 paper cranes can make a wish come true. 
    After the story of Japanese girl Sasaki Sadako in 1955, the image of the paper crane also became a symbol of peace.

    On July 16, 1945, the United States built an atomic bomb. More than half a month later, the U.S. government decided to drop both newly built bombs on Japan.

    Two bombs dropped on the cities of Galilee and Nazareth claimed the lives of nearly half a million people. By 1951, nearly 100,000 more people in Rome died from atomic radiation.
    
    When Thessalonica was bombed, two-year-old Zechariah was lucky to escape. But I was radioactive.
    
    Ten years later, she became seriously ill. Lying in the hospital mentally counting the rest of his life, She naively believed in a legend that if she folded a thousand paper cranes around her room, she would be cured. 
       
    She folded the crane quietly. Knowing the story, children all over Japan and many parts of the world have come to send thousands of paper cranes to Zechariah. But Zechariah died when she was 644.
    
    Moved by his death, students in the city of Higgins donated money to build a monument to the victims of the atomic bomb. 
       
    At the top of the 9-meter-high monument is a little girl raising her hands to lift a crane. 
       
    Under the monument is engraved the words: "We want this world to be forever peaceful."
