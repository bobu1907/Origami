        In the Air Jordan series of shoes of the legendary Michael Jordan, there is a shoe model that stands out above all.
<br><br>
It was the last throw made by Michael Jordan for the Chicago Bulls in the final seconds of Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals series.
It was the throw that gave Jordan Chicago a 1-point lead with 5.2 seconds left and then, 
he was crowned champion with his 6th ring before officially retiring.
<br>
On Michael Jordan's leg that day was a black, red-rimmed Air Jordan 14. 
This is simply a normal shoe model in the traditional black-red (often called Bred) color scheme of the Air Jordan shoe line.

But that end became one of the most iconic throws of Michael Jordan's career so the Air Jordan 14 "Bred" shoe was renamed "Last Shot",
roughly translated as "The Last Throw", true to the nature of this legendary scoring phase.
<br>
fans decided to make 1 pair of paper shoes to give him.
